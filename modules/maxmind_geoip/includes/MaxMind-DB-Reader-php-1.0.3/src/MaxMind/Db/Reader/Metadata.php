/**
 * This class provides the metadata for the MaxMind DB file.
 *
 * @property integer nodeCount This is an unsigned 32-bit integer indicating
 * the number of nodes in the search tree.
 *
 * @property integer recordSize This is an unsigned 16-bit integer. It
 * indicates the number of bits in a record in the search tree. Note that each
 * node consists of two records.
 *
 * @property integer ipVersion This is an unsigned 16-bit integer which is
 * always 4 or 6. It indicates whether the database contains IPv4 or IPv6
 * address data.
 *
 * @property string databaseType This is a string that indicates the structure
 * of each data record associated with an IP address. The actual definition of
 * these structures is left up to the database creator.
 *
 * @property array languages An array of strings, each of which is a language
 * code. A given record may contain data items that have been localized to
 * some or all of these languages. This may be undefined.
 *
 * @property integer binaryFormatMajorVersion This is an unsigned 16-bit
 * integer indicating the major version number for the database's binary
 * format.
 *
 * @property integer binaryFormatMinorVersion This is an unsigned 16-bit
 * integer indicating the minor version number for the database's binary format.
 *
 * @property integer buildEpoch This is an unsigned 64-bit integer that
 * contains the database build timestamp as a Unix epoch value.
 *
 * @property array description This key will always point to a map
 * (associative array). The keys of that map will be language codes, and the
 * values will be a description in that language as a UTF-8 string. May be
 * undefined for some databases.
