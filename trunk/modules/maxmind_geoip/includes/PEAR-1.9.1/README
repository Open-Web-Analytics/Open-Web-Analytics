MDB2 (database abstraction), HTML_QuickForm (HTML forms management),
PhpDocumentor (auto-documentation generator), DB_DataObject
(Data Access Abstraction), and many hundreds more.  Browse all
available packages at http://pear.php.net, the list is constantly
growing and updating to reflect improvements in the PHP language.
